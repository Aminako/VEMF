Installation
--------------------------
1.	Download the Github Zip folder and open it with your unPacker of choice.
	You can find the newest release here:
	> https://github.com/SMVampire/VEMF/releases
	
2.	Extract it to your Desktop or somewhere where you won't lose it.
	Inside the Zip is this Readme.MD, and the folders "Binaries", "Changelogs", "Mission Files", and "VEMF".
	
3.	Open the "Mission Files" folder where you will see "init.sqf" and "initServer.sqf".
	You need to put these two files in your Mission.PBO (or Folder) alongside your description.ext file.
	If you already have an "init.sqf" there, you will need to open my version and copy the contents to your existing file.
	
4.	Open the "Binaries" folder where you will find "VEMF.PBO".
	You need to navigate to the "@EpochHive\Addons" folder on your server and copy "VEMF.PBO" into it.
	
5.	(Options) You can edit "VEMFConfig.sqf" to your liking. It is located in the "VEMF.PBO".
	You can also instead put a copy of "VEMFConfig.sqf" in your Mission.PBO for easier edits.
	The server checks the Mission.PBO for the Config before checking the server side.
	The Mission.PBO version takes precedence.
